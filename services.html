                      Speech and language therapy is individualized instruction provided by an SLP to
                      improve speech or language skills in a person who has been diagnosed with a delay or a
                      disorder.  Speech therapy focuses on the production of speech sounds and overall intelligibility
                      of speech.  Language therapy covers expressive and receptive skills.  Expressive language
                      skills include using appropriate vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to effectively
                      communicate.   Expressive language skills also target conversational skills such as turn-taking,
                      topic-maintenance and knowing how to convey a message depending on your audience.
                      Receptive language skills include understanding vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure,
                      as well as interpreting non-verbal communication cues.

                      Wonderful!  Speech and Language Connections is available to help provide additional
                      support in the hopes of remediating their delay or disorder more quickly.  School based
                      services focus on educational impact which may limit the areas that the school SLP can target.
                      Private therapy has the flexibility of treating a wider range of delays and is able to consider the
                      impact of the delay/disorder not only on education, but on daily functioning in the home, in
                      their social group and in the community.  Also, if your student has a current IEP and evaluation,
                      an evaluation may not be needed through Speech and Language Connections as the
                      information from the educational assessment may be used to determine goals for your child.

                      Possibly.  The school system is bound by eligibility criteria determined by their district
                      or state that is more limited than a private practice setting.    The school-based SLP must
                      determine that there is a significant educational impact that is the result of a speech/language
                      delay.  So, a student may have a lisp or a mild stutter, but if the child is academically
                      successful, then the student would not qualify because there would be no significant
                      educational impact. The private setting is not limited by that criteria and can provide therapy
                      for all delays and disorders.
