                Nicole Jonak, MS CCC-SLP, is a speech-language pathologist who after working for the Evergreen Public Schools over 13-years, has decided to
                shift gears to provide speech/language therapy to students in a private-practice type setting.   She has had the opportunity to work with a wide-
                range of students who were impacted by learning disabilities, developmental delays, health impairments and the autism spectrum over that
                time.  Given her experience in the school system, she is highly familiar with the state expectations for students and the special education
                process.  In addition to being licensed in Washington, she is also ASHA certified.
                <br><br>
                She enjoys making therapy fun and applicable to life outside of the therapy room.  She feels passionate about involving the child’s family in the
                process of supporting the child’s communication goals in the home setting.   She specializes in working with children who have expressive and
                receptive language disorders, articulation and phonology disorders, as well as pragmatic (social communication) disorders.
                Nicole has lived in the Pacific Northwest her entire life, specifically Spokane, Washington and currently Portland, Oregon.  She enjoys hiking, live
                theater/music and spending as much time with her young nephews as she can.
